# Fog-non-Fog-classification-with-computer-vision
This Python code is designed to analyze PNG images and determine whether they are “foggy”. It does this by computing the average horizontal variance of pixel intensities in a grayscale version of each image. For each row of pixels, it calculates the mean intensity and then measures how much the pixels deviate from that mean (the variance). Rows that are very uniform—common in foggy or blurry images—have low variance, while rows with sharp details have high variance. The function returns the average variance across all rows as a single measure of the image’s horizontal detail.

The main loop goes through all PNG files in the current directory, converts each to grayscale, and applies this variance measure. It then compares the result to a threshold of 200: if the average variance is below this threshold, the image is labeled “FOGGY”, otherwise “NOT FOGGY”. The output prints the numeric variance, the fog status, and the file name. Essentially, the script provides a simple, pixel-based way to automatically detect fog or blurriness in images, though it is relatively slow because it processes each pixel individually rather than using optimized array operations.
